Name of Project: Armada-X

Project's Purpose or Goal: Create a 3D galaga type video game that a user can enjoy playing during their downtime.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* space environment for the battle
* basic 3D skeletal framework for the player
* basic #D skeletal framework for an enemy
* alien can attack player's ship
* player can shoot at enemy's ship

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* HTML
* CSS
* JSX
* JavaScript
* dat.GUI API
* react-three/drei
* React Three Fiber/Three.js
* Sketchfab
* source of soundtrack/sounds effect to be determined
* React

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Add sound effects/soundtrack tied to specific events such shoot down an enemy
* Add higher game levels to increase game difficulty(level 2, level 3, etc. )
* Add different type of enemys ships

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Requires more research

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? 

I will have to do more research on game creation and react-three-fiber and three.js
